# resume-template

*This is a simple Jekyll + GitHub Pages powered template.*

### Notes

I've modified the HTML located in `_layouts/resume.html` to point to my main Github Page's profile picture stored in `http://minimalistic.github.io/images/jason_profile.jpg`, that way one can change the profile pic in just one place rather than two. 

### Template Origins
The original template and creator: [resume-template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template) by [@jglovier](https://github.com/jglovier)
