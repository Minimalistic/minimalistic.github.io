  description: The main purpose of this project was to create a reporting tool in Python that printed out reports based on the data in the provided SQL database. After creating the required queries, I took the project a step further and developed a text based user interface that provides the user a simple menu which allows them to select a database query they want and then have the results printed back to them when the query is completed.
